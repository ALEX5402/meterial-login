_an unofficial Steam client for Android_

While being based on the protobuf-based WebUI-oriented RPC/API, this app will miss a lot of features due to some of them are binded to AJAX API (wishlist) or reviews/app descriptions (not present in API at all)
Also, the app itself is highly experimental - keep this in mind.
